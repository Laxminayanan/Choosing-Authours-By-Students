ðŸ§© *Problem Statement*

In classroom environments, organizing student seminar presentations often involves manually assigning topics (Authour In This Case), which can lead to issues such as duplicate selections, inconsistent record-keeping, and inefficient communication between students and faculty. With increasing class sizes and the need for streamlined academic coordination, traditional methods fall short in ensuring fairness, traceability, and ease of use.

There is a need for a *robust, user-friendly, and automated system* that allows students to *uniquely select one Topic (Authour In This Case)* from a predefined list for seminar presentations. The system should validate student identity, prevent duplicate selections, and maintain persistent records in an organized format that faculty can easily review.

To address this, a *Console-Based Author Allocation System* is proposed. This system will:

* Provide real-time validation for student inputs (name, roll number, branch, section),
* Present an interactive and updated list of available authors with unique codes,
* Ensure that each author is chosen only once,
* Save student selections and associated metadata (e.g., serial number, timestamp) to an Excel sheet.
* Maintain data consistency across sessions by updating supporting Python files that track availability and serial numbers.

This solution aims to *digitize, automate, and streamline* the author/topic selection processâ€”ensuring fairness, improving administrative efficiency, and offering flexibility for other academic allocation tasks such as project topic selection or elective course registration.
